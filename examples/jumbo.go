// You need to enable memory jumbo for maxPacketSegment more than 2014.
// Explanation: internal packet buffers are 2048 bytes, first packet will have
// ethernet and ipv4 headers = 14 + 2 = 34 bytes.
// Buffer will overflows if maxPacketSegment > 2048 - 34 = 2014 bytes

// Note: usage of 1484 < maxPacketSegment < 2014 without memory jumbo can work
// on some NICs, but is treated as underfined behaviour
// Explanation: in this situation packet will be fit in internal buffers
// however packet will be more than 1518 bytes - Ethernet max non-jumbo frame

// You need to enale chained jumbo for requiredPacketLength > maxPacketSegment
// Explanation: if required length is more than segment length packet will consist of
// several chained segments. You should enable chained jumbo to correctly handle them

// Note: usage of maxPacketSegment > 2014 and also requiredPacketLength > maxPacketSegment
// is forbidden. If you decicde to chain packets you shouldn't chain non-standart packets
// Explanation: in this situation you will need to enable both
// memory and chained jumbo and this is forbidden
